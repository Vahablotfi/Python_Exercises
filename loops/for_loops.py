(for Loop Version): Multiplication Table for Numbers 1-9
Explanation:
We use two for loops:
The outer loop iterates through numbers 1 to 9 (for which we generate tables).
The inner loop iterates from 1 to 10 to print the multiplication table for each number.
The output is formatted to display each table clearly.
Instructions:
1. Initialize a variable (num) for the multiplication table starting from 1.
2. Use a for loop to iterate num from 1 to 9.
3. Inside this loop, use another for loop for numbers 1 to 10.
4. Print each multiplication result, then increment counters properly.
