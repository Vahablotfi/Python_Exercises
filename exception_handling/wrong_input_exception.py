Handling User Input with Exceptions
Objective:
Prevent program crashes caused by invalid input and division by zero.

The function below takes two numbers as input and divides them.
However, the program crashes if:
- The user enters a non-numeric value.
- The user tries to divide by zero.

Your task:
1. Identify the **potential runtime errors**.
2. Modify the function to **handle exceptions gracefully**.
3. Ensure the program **keeps asking for valid input** if an error occurs.
